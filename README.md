# 🪐 Exoplanet Habitability Score Analyzer

**Field**: Astrobiology, Planetary Science, Computational Modeling  
**Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy  
**Why I Do Research**: I was always intrigued by Enrico Fermi's famous paradox, which states the possibility that extraterrestrial life exists but we are unable to find it. By using real scientific data and specific calculations and data processing, this project will reveal how rare Earth's environment might be, and why life as we know it could be so precious.<br>

## 🔍 Abstraction
This project analyzes real exoplanet data and ranks planets by potential habitability using criteria like temperature, atmosphere, stellar flys, and size. In this project, we define a **custom habitability score (HS)**, inspired by Earth similarity index models and data sets. The data and the research in this experiment is inspired by the Earth Similarity Index data.

## 🧪 Scientific Method

**Question**: Which known exoplanets are most likely to support human-compatible life?<br>
**Hypothesis**: Given current exoplanet discoveries, only a small fraction (likely <5%) of known exoplanets meet the minimum physical and biological conditions necessary for human life,  
**Experiment**: Design a scoring model, analyze data from NASA's Exoplanet Archive and more data
**Conclusion**: [After your data analysis!]

## ⚙️ Score Criteria (Tentative)

| Factor            | Target Value (Earth-Based) |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Temperature       | 273K–373K (liquid water)   |
| Gravity           | 0.5g – 2g                  |
| Stellar Flux      | ~1 (Earth = 1)             |
| Radius            | 0.5R – 2R                  |
| Orbital Zone      | Habitable zone only        |
| Atmospheric Data  | [If available]             |

Each planet will be given a score from 0 to 1 based on how closely it matches Earth.
