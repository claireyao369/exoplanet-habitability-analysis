# Exoplanet Habitability Score Analyzer

**Field**: Astrobiology, Planetary Science, Computational Modeling<br>
**Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib(maybe), NumPy(maybe)<br>
**Why it Matters**: I was always intrigued by Enrico Fermi's famous paradox, which states possibilities that extraterrestrial life exist but we are unable to find them. By using real scientific data and specific calculations and data processing, this project will reveal how rare Earth's environment might be, and why life as we know it could be so precious.<br>

# Abstraction
This project analyzes real exoplanet data and ranks planets by potential habitability using criteria like temperature, atmosphere, stellar flys, and size. In this project, we define a **custom habitability score (HS)**, inspired by earth similarity index models and data sets.

# Scientific Method
**Questions**: Which known exoplanets are most likely to support human-compatible life?<br>
**Hypothesis**: Given current exoplanet discoveries, only a small fraction (likely <5%) of known exoplanets meet the minimum physical and biological conditions necessary for human life, such as Earth-like temperature, atmosphere, gravity, and radiation levels.
**Experiment**: Design a scoring model, analyze data from
